Slog is developped by Universit√© Gustave Eiffel within the `department GERS <https://gers.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr>`_
 
The initial version of geology, geometry and interserction modules were realised by Jad Sadek. The intersection module was based on the work of Erich Foster, Kai Hormann and Romeo Traian Popa (doi.org/10.1016/j.cagx.2019.100007).
